  How To Build and Install libLE
  ==============================

  This package does not provide an automated way to install the libraries. After
  building them, you need to copy by yourself the resulting files into
  appropriate places.

  Executing "make" with no targe specified lists supported targets:

      all: builds all the libraries into the "build" directory. The directory
           has two sub-directories, "include" to which header files go and "lib"
           to which static and shared objects go.

      cbl: builds only the libraries belonged to CBL. Since the Memory
           Management Library has two versions, two versions of CBL are
           generated with different names; "cbl" for production code and "cbld"
           for debugging code. Necessary headers are also placed in the
           "build/include" directory.

      cdsl: builds only the libraries belonged to CDSL. Necessary headers are
            also placed in the "build/include" directory.

      cel: builds only the libraries belonged to CEL. Necessary headers are also
           placed in the "build/include" directory.

      clean: deletes all files generated when buliding the libraries. Unless you
             add files, "make clean" leaves only the files that were in the
             distribution.

  Even if separate building of libraries is specified, all libraries in CDSL and
  most in CEL depend on CBL, thus require it.

  After the libraries built, you can install them by placing the library files
  into a library directory for your system (e.g., /usr/local/lib), the headers
  into an include directory (e.g., /usr/local/include) and the man-pages into a
  man-page directory (e.g., /usr/local/man/man3). For example, on my machine,
  the following instructions install the libraries with their headers:

      cp -R build/include/* /usr/local/include/
      cp build/lib/* /usr/local/lib/
      ldconfig

  where it is assumed that ld.so.conf has "/usr/local/lib" in it, and the
  following ones install man pages for them:

      cp doc/man3/cbl/* /usr/local/man/man3/
      cp doc/man3/cdsl/* /usr/local/man/man3/
      cp doc/man3/cel/* /usr/local/man/man3/

  Installed successfully, you can use the libraries by including necessary
  headers in your code as in:

      #include <cbl/arena.h>    /* use the Arena Library */
      #include <cdsl/hash.h>    /* use the Hash Library */
      ...

  and invoking your compiler with an option specifying the libraries to use, for
  example:

      cc myprg.c -lcdsl -lcbl

  Note that the order in which libraries are given to the compiler is
  significant; all of CDSL depend on CBL, which is the reason "-lcbl" follows
  "-lcdsl" in the arguments for the compiler.
