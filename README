  ocelot: A Language Extension Library
  ====================================

  ocelot is a collection of libraries to provide features that the C language
  lacks, various data structures that most programs use in common, and
  facilities for interaction between a program and its environment. Each library
  has its own version number and modification logs.

  This package collects libraries into three categories called CBL, CDSL and
  CEL. Libraries belonging to CBL (C Basic Library) provide features that the C
  language lacks and include alternative memory allocators and an exception
  handling facility. Those to CDSL (C Data Structure Library) implement various
  data structures frequently used by most programs. Those to CEL (C Environment
  Library) aid interaction between programs and the execution environment.

  The cbl, cdsl and cel directories contain sub-directories for the libraries of
  each category:
  - cbl: C Basic Library
      - arena: The Arena Library (lifetime-based memory allocator)
      - assert: The Assertion Library
      - except: The Exception Handling Library
      - memory: The Memory Management Library
      - text: The Text Library (high-level string manipulation)
  - cdsl: C Data Structure Library
      - dlist: The Doubly-linked List Library
      - hash: The Hash Library
      - list: The List Library (singly-linked list)
      - set: The Set Library
      - stack: The Stack Library
      - table: The Table Library
  - cel: C Environment Library
      - conf: The Configuration File Library (configuration file parser)
      - opt: The Option Parsing Library (option parser)

  Libraries are documented by Doxygen (http://www.doxygen.org). The doc
  directory contains HTML, PDF and man-page versions of the documents.

  INSTALL explains how to build and install the libraries. For the copyright
  issues, see the accompanying LICENSE file.
